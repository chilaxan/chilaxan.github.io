Hi, my names Jordan and this is my blog. I've been programming since middle school, and my main interests are pentesting, reverse engineering, and web applications.

Here is where I plan on posting lots of my obscure research and interesting projects. Expect to see a lot of python, odd memory tricks, with other random things interspersed.

Enjoy!
